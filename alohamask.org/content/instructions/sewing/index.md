_These instructions are also [available as a PDF](https://github.com/alohamask/design/raw/master/resources/aloha_mask_instructions.pdf)._

Thank you for your interest receiving materials and sewing masks for **alohamask**. These instructions are for those that have signed up to sew masks from kits that we will be providing, and then setting out the completed masks for our Delivery Volunteers to pick up.

 We will provide your phone number and address to each Delivery Volunteer; they are instructed to text you for specifics of how to drop off kits to you when they arrive, and leave the kits on your doorstep or other location you specify.
 
We want to emphasize safety and social distancing; as such, we will be providing all drivers with one mask to wear during their volunteer work.  We also ask that you use the first mask you assemble from the provided kits to wear while assembling the remaining kits.

### Safety and Mask Kit Management

* Please sanitize any work surfaces before assembly of any mask kits.
* Please wear a mask while assembling kits; you may use the first mask in your kit for this purpose.
* Please follow instructions at https://alohamask.org/instructions/ for assembly; please let us know if any clarification is needed.
* Please maintain social distancing of 6 feet or greater at all times.
* Please return all assembled masks to the bag the materials came in.
* After you have finished sewing all the masks in your kit, please contact the Volunteer Coordinator via either email or text message, who will then arrange for the kits to be picked up by a Delivery Volunteer.
* Please coordinate with the Delivery Volunteer to leave the kits in a safe place for them after you have verified they are outside to pick it up; please keep the completed masks indoors until they arrive to pick it up.
*  Please wash your hands before and after handling any boxes or materials; all goods will be provided to you in initially sanitary bags,and want to do our best to keep things as close to sterile as possible in the sewing environments.
* __If at ANY point you are feeling ill or sick, please cease work and contact the Volunteer Coordinator ASAP.__

### What You Need

* Basic sewing supplies
* Aloha fu face mask kit

### Sewing Instructions
##### 1. Join center seam

Note which side of the fabric is intended to be externally facing for the finished mask (i.e., the “good side”). Overlap two pieces of fabric such that the good sides are facing each other. Sew along the curved edge to form the center seam.

Repeat this step for both the outer fabric and the inner fabric.

##### 2. Sew the outer to the inner fabric

Sew the inner (lining) fabric to the outer (main) fabric.
* Place the lining fabric down with _the good side up_.
* Place the main fabric on top with the _good side down_. You should now have both layers of your mask on top of each other with _good sides facing together_.

* Sew the top and bottom seams, making sure to leave the sides open so we can turn the mask inside-out later.

##### 3. Turn the mask inside-out

Turn the mask inside out such that the good sides are externally facing.

##### 4. Make the straps

To keep the straps from fraying fold and stitch the strap edges.

##### 5. Attach the straps to the side of the mask and edge-stitch the opening

Attach four straps to the top and bottom corners of the mask (either to the inner liner or outer liner or both). The two straps attached to the bottom two corners should be roughly parallel with the bottom edge of the mask to allow for tying behind the head. The two straps attached to the upper two corners should be pointing up at roughly 45 degree angle from the bottom edge of the mask to allow for tying on top of the head. 

Edge stitch the sides of the outer and inner linings to prevent fraying. Note that the sides are expected to remain open to allow additional filter material to be inserted in between the linings, as needed.
