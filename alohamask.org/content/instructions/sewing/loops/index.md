**These instructions are also available as a [PDF](https://github.com/alohamask/design/raw/master/resources/head_loop_instructions.pdf)**
1. **Cut strips approximately 15 inches (~38 cm). You'll need a total of twenty 15 inch-length strips (twenty ~38cm-length strips).** Optional: Measure length of entire elastic strip and cut. Calculate length for 20 strips to be between 14-1/2 to 16-1/2 inches. (~37 to ~42 cm). Try to get individual strips as long as possible. It is okay for some masks to have shorter elastics and others longer, _but the top and bottom elastic head loops MUST be the same length._

2. **With mask RIGHTSIDE out, take raw edges and turn in 1/4 to 3/8 inch (~3mm to 1cm). Press.**

3. **At a mask corner, insert ~3/4 to 1 inch (~2-2.5 cm) of elastic in between the layers.**

5. **Top stitch again closer to the edge of the mask.**

6. **Place loops on the matching side. Top stitch.** Take care not to twist the length of the elastic.

7. **Top stitch zigzag over the elastic. Do not skip this step.** Zigzag stitch width: ~4.5mm. Feel for the inserted elastic. Adjust needle position to catch most of the elastic.

**Notes:**

Users report masks that do not rely on pressure on the ears are more
comfortable for extended wear.

This mask is designed to accommodate most head circumferences.
One-size-fits-all does not exist. Wearers may tie knots to size.

After this mask is constructed, top stitching the perimeter of the mask
is okay. Please top stitch no more than 1/8 inch (~3 mm) from the
edges.
