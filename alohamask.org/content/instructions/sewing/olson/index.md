### Olson Pattern

Before you start:

- Make sure your sewing machine is setup with correct tension. 
- If you are pinning the pieces together, pin them at the seam allowance otherwise you might ruin the mask.
- Please sanitize any work surfaces before assembly of any mask kits.
- Please wear a mask while assembling kits; you may use the first mask in your kit for this purpose.
- Please let us know if any clarification is needed, if you are having trouble so is someone else. That means our instructions need work.
- Please maintain social distancing of 6 feet or greater at all times.
- Please return all assembled masks to the bag the materials came in.
- After you have finished sewing all the masks in your kit, please contact the Volunteer Coordinator via either email or text message, who will then arrange for the kits to be picked up by a Delivery Volunteer.
- Please coordinate with the Delivery Volunteer to leave the kits in a safe place for them after you have verified they are outside to pick it up; please keep the completed masks indoors until they arrive to pick it up.
- Please wash your hands before and after handling any boxes or materials; all goods will be provided to you in initially sanitary bags,and want to do our best to keep things as close to sterile as possible in the sewing environments.
- __If at ANY point you are feeling ill or sick, please cease work and contact the Volunteer Coordinator ASAP.__
- Seam Allowance - 1/4 inch (6.4mm)
- Stitch Length - 10-12 stitches per inch (~2.5mm)

There are three main pieces to the Olson mask. We will refer to them as shown in the picture below:

{{< figureCupper

caption="Olson Mask pieces"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

- Piece 1 makes up the front of the mask.
- Piece 2 makes up the back of the mask and the filter pocket.
- Phase 3 makes up the sides of the mask and the attachment points for the straps or ear loops.

#### Step 1:
Take two mirror front pieces (#1 above) and align them right sides together.

{{< figureCupper
img="step2.jpg" 
caption="Join two pieces #1"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

After sewing the two pieces together, it should look something like this:

{{< figureCupper
img="step3.jpg" 
caption="End result of Step 1"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 2:
Repeat step 1, this time sewing together the front pieces. After completing steps 1 and 2, you should end up with two pieces that look like this:

{{< figureCupper
img="step4.jpg" 
caption="End result of Step 2"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 3:
Starting from the **Back** piece you made in Step 2. Fold the straight edges towards the wrong side and stitch them to prevent fraying:

{{< figureCupper
img="step5.jpg" 
caption="Stitch down the straight edges."
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You will end up with something that looks like this:

{{< figureCupper
img="step6.jpg" 
caption="End result of Step 3."
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 4:
Now take the **Front** and **Back** pieces. Turn the **Front** piece right side out.  Turn the The **Front** and **Back** are nesting in each other, printed layers together.

Notice how the printed sides of the fabric are together.

Stitch along the top of the two pieces:

You will end up with a piece that looks like this:

{{< figureCupper

 caption="Result of Step 5."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 5:
Stitch along the bottom of the piece you made in Step 4:
 
{{< figureCupper

 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You will end up with a piece that looks like this:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step12.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 5."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 6:
Next we will attach the **Side** to the result of Step 5. Align the straight edges of the two pieces as shown below: 
   
{{< figureCupper
 img="step13.jpg" 
 caption="Align pieces."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Stitch down the two pieces along the edges:

{{< figureCupper

 caption="Result of step 5."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Now do the same for the other side:

{{< figureCupper

 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Your mask will look like this:

{{< figureCupper

options="700x" >}}

{{< figureCupper
 img="step18.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 6.(Front)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 7:

Kits will be delivered with ties or ear loops. There will be 40 ties with each kit, or an 80 inch strip of 1 inch knit stretchy material for making ear loops.

**If your mask came with straps refer to the instructions for attaching straps [here]({{< ref "/instructions/sewing/straps#example-attaching-straps-to-mask-olson-pattern" >}}) or as a [separate PDF](https://github.com/alohamask/design/raw/master/resources/olson_strap_installation.pdf).**

If your mask came with stretchy ear loops continue with these instructions. Cut two 4 inch pieces of knit ribbon:

{{< figureCupper

 caption="4 inch ear loops."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}



### Attaching the Ear loops:
There are two different ways of attaching ear loops. Make sure you read both and choose the one you are most comfortable with:

#### First method of attaching ear loops.

#### Step 1:
Turn your mask inside out. It should look like this:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step19.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 1.(Back)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

{{< figureCupper
 img="step20.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 1.(Front)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 2:
Fold the edges of the mask:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step22.jpg" 
 caption="Folding the sides of the mask."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

{{< figureCupper
 img="step21.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 2."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 3:

Place the ear loops into the folded edges of the mask:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step24.jpg" 
 caption="Place the ear loops into the mask"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You can pin the ear loops in place without compromising the mask, but you will find that after a few masks, you can close the edges without pinning. Next, stitch the edge closed:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step25.jpg" 
 caption="Stitch the edges closed"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

### Alternative way of adding ear loops:

Once you finish Step 6, before turning the mask inside out place the cut ribbon between the **Front** and **Side** pieces as shown below. Make sure the ribbon is folded 

{{< figureCupper
 img="step28.jpg" 
 caption="Place the ear loops into the mask."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Stitch at the white dashed lines to close the edges of the mask. Be careful to catch ONLY the ends of the knit strip while you stitch the sides closed.  Back stitch several times at the knit strip ends to reinforce.
After stitching the edges closed, turn the mask rightside out. Mask is done.

#### You are done!
Congratulations, you finished a mask! A first mask may take 30 minutes or so, but once you get comfortable with the pattern and these steps, you can cut that time down to 10-15 minutes. Here is a picture of what your mask should look like:

{{< figureCupper

options="700x" >}}


### Adding a nose clamp:

Only add a nose clamp if your kit came with them. Some hospitals will add it on site. Nose clamp directions are found here [here]({{< ref "/instructions/sewing/nose_bridge" >}})

### Chain stitching:
Once you are comfortable with the pattern, consider chain stitching the pieces together. This will make sewing mask much faster and save on thread. Check out these awesome directions one of our sewing volunteers put together:

### Resources:
The original Olson pattern PDF is available [on our GitHub](https://github.com/alohamask/design/raw/master/resources/olson_pattern_v3.pdf). AlohaMask Olson pattern is modified to save on fabric, and accommodate strap and ear loop attachment.
