### Olson Pattern

The original Olson pattern PDF is available [on our GitHub](https://github.com/alohamask/design/raw/master/resources/olson_pattern_v3.pdf). AlohaMask Olson pattern is modified to save on fabric, and accommodate strap and ear loop attachment. 
Before you start:
- Make sure you read all of the instruction steps before you start.
- Make sure your sewing machine is setup with correct tension.
- Make sure your workplace is clean. 
- If you are pinning the pieces together, pin them at the seam allowance otherwise you might ruin the mask.
 
There are three main pieces to the Olson mask. We will refer to them as shown in the picture below:

#### Step 1:
Take two mirror pieces (#1 above) and align them right sides together.

{{< figureCupper

caption="Join two pieces #1"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

After sewing the two pieces together, it should look something like this:

{{< figureCupper
img="step3.jpg" 
caption="End result of Step 1"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 2:
Repeat step 1, this time sewing together the pieces shown as #2 above. After completing steps 1 and 2, you should end up with two pieces that look like this:

{{< figureCupper
img="step4.jpg" 
caption="End result of Step 2"
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 3:
Starting from the piece you made in Step 2. Fold the straight edges towards the wrong side and stitch them to prevent fraying:

{{< figureCupper
img="step5.jpg" 
caption="Stitch down the straight edges."
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You will end up with something that looks like this:

{{< figureCupper
img="step6.jpg" 
caption="End result of Step 3."
command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 4:
Now take piece you made in Step 3 and Step 1. Align them right sides together:
 
{{< figureCupper
 img="step8.jpg" 
 caption="Align pieces."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Stitch along the top of the two pieces:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step9.jpg" 
 caption="Stitch along the top."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You will end up with a piece that looks like this:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step10.jpg" 
 caption="Result of Step 5."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 5:
Stitch along the bottom of the piece you made in Step 4:
 
{{< figureCupper
 img="step11.jpg" 
 caption="Stitch along the bottom."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You will end up with a piece that looks like this:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step12.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 5."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 6:
Next we will attach pattern piece 3 to the result of Step 5. Align the straight edges of the two pieces as shown below: 
   
{{< figureCupper
 img="step13.jpg" 
 caption="Align pieces."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Stitch down the two pieces along the edges:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step14.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 5."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Now do the same for the other side:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step15.jpg" 
 caption="Align pieces."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

Your mask will look like this:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step17.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 6.(Back)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

{{< figureCupper
 img="step18.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 6.(Front)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 7:
Turn your mask inside out. It should look like this:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step19.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 7.(Back)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

{{< figureCupper
 img="step20.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 7.(Front)"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 8:
Fold the edges of the mask:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step22.jpg" 
 caption="Folding the sides of the mask."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

{{< figureCupper
 img="step21.jpg" 
 caption="Result of step 8."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 9:

Kits will be delivered with ties or ear loops. There will be 40 ties with each kit, or an 80 inch strip of 1 inch knit stretchy material for making ear loops.

**If your mask came with straps refer to the instructions for attaching straps [here]({{< ref "/instructions/sewing/straps#example-attaching-straps-to-mask-olson-pattern" >}}) or as a [separate PDF](https://github.com/alohamask/design/raw/master/resources/olson_strap_installation.pdf).**

If your mask came with stretchy ear loops continue with these instructions. Cut two 4 inch pieces of knit ribbon:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step23.jpg" 
 caption="4 inch ear loops."
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 10:

Place the ear loops into the folded edges of the mask:

{{< figureCupper
 img="step24.jpg" 
 caption="Place the ear loops into the mask"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

You can pin the ear loops in place without compromising the mask, but you will find that after a few masks, you can close the edges without pinning. Next, stitch the edge closed:

{{< figureCupper

 caption="Stitch the edges closed"
 command="Resize" 
options="700x" >}}

#### Step 11:
Congratulations, you are Done! A first mask may take 30 minutes or so, but once you get comfortable with the pattern and these steps, you can cut that time down to 10-15 minutes. Here is a picture of what your mask should look like:

### Adding a nose clamp:

Only add a nose clamp if your kit came with them. Some hospitals will add it on site. Nose clamp directions are found here [here]({{< ref "/instructions/sewing/nose_bridge" >}})

### Chain stitching:
Once you are comfortable with the pattern, consider chain stitching the pieces together. This will make sewing mask much faster and save on thread. Check out these awesome directions one of our sewing volunteers put together:
