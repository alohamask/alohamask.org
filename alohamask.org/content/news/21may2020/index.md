We have been BUSY!  Thank you to our over 200 sewing and delivery volunteers who have helped us to produce over 4000 masks.  Because of you, we are making a direct impact in our local community.

We are happy to announce that we have completed mask deliveries to the Honolulu Fire Department and the Shriners Hospital for Children in Honolulu, helping to keep our frontline healthcare and emergency service workers safe.

We are working to deliver an additional 1000 ready-to-use masks that we have in stock to healthcare workers based on need, and have another set of masks that we have cut and are ready for assembly from donated cloth that we have received from Kokua Kupuna Healthcare.

As we near the end of May, we are also starting to transition back to a sense of normalcy.  Because of this, we will no longer have access to our cutting facilities as of May 23rd.  We have already cut enough material to have 4 more weeks of production capacity, but after that, we will be reviewing whether there is still a pressing need for us to make masks, and whether we have enough volunteers who are able to continue giving their time in assembling them.

We will continue to work hard to get as many masks as we can out to those who need them!

Mahalo!
