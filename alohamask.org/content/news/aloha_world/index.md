##### Talk Story

First, we would like to start by thanking all of our volunteers for the endless hours they are pouring into **alohamask**. Without all of you, none of this would be possible. Together, we can _(and will)_ make a difference.

**alohamask** was started by Sergey Negrashov, Ph.D. (an applied physicist at Oceanit) and Chris Ketter, a Ph.D. student physicist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. They designed a process for laser cutting mask templates from cloth. These templates can be packaged as kits and distributed to volunteers who are willing to sew the kits into complete masks. Sergey and Chris recruited other volunteers from academia (UHM) and industry (Oceanit) to create **alohamask**.

**alohamask** is now a 100% volunteer run organization for connecting volunteers with other volunteers as well as with essential workers. Our goal is to streamline the design, implementation, and delivery of masks to hospitals and essential workers.

To achieve this, we are coordinating efforts between volunteers that want to donate material, volunteers who want to deliver material, and volunteers who are willing to sew. We are also partnering with others in healthcare, industry, and non-profits to better understand how we might be able to work together to safely produce and distribute as many masks as possible.

Consisting mostly of scientists, academics, and engineers, we strive to make this an open process. The source for this site, designs, templates, instructions, and other materials are open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/alohamask/). We want others who are trying to provide similar efforts locally to be able to use the work we've put into this to get setup quickly and begin serving their communities. We will continually look into ways of better disseminating these materials, making them available to the widest audience possible. 

We face many challenges and will be discussing those in our news items. Recent discussions have been centered around the types of material we will be requesting for donation, the particular templates that will be laser cut, how to sanitize the materials, the safety of our volunteers, and the best way to distribute materials during a state-at-home order. Our team of volunteers are working together and with other organizations to solve these issues. We will keep you updated as this movement progresses.

As a parting note, if you have any interest in volunteering, please get in touch with us. We are looking for fabric donations, volunteers for delivery, and volunteers with a sewing machine who are willing to sew.

Please stay safe. Together, we will get through this.
